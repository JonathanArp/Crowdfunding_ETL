Project 2

Ths repository contains all requirements for Project 2. I have a completed ipynb file that imports data and exports all four requested CSV's. Additionally, I have included the sql file which contains the information for setting up the tables and their relationships with each other. I was able to successfully import the data into the tables after they were created.
